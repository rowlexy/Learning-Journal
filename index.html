            <h2>My new journey as a software developer</h2>
            <p>After several months of learning in the frontend Developer Career Path, 
                I have made the big jump to also dive into the backend developer Career Path.
                I am committed to dedicating my time and resources to acquire the required skills and knowledge
                needed to excel in this role.
            </p>

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend lots of hours learning,
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things 
                about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                After each learning session, I would use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                summaries of what I learnedusing my own words.
            </p>
            <p>
                That helped me learn at my pace and I quite understood every lesson. I also realized that posting
                my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.

                    <h3>Yoga</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yoga can help with concentration through calming your mind and removing the 
                        distracting thoughts.

                    <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Running and software engineering are two very different disciplines. 
                        Running is fundamentally a very simple activity, software engineering can be pretty complex. 
                        So how can slamming your ham poles against the ground repeatedly to the point of exhaustion 
                        improve your coding? That’s what I’m going to try lay out here.

                    <h3>Relaxation</h3>
                    <p>
                        There’s something about spending time on the beach that helps melt stress and put you in a better 
                        mindset. It’s not in your head some science explains the different reasons the shore helps you relax. 
                        Although researchers continue to explore these awesome side effects, take it as further proof that, 
                        yes, you really do need a beach vacation!
